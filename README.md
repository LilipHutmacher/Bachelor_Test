# Bachelor_Test
Test repository for my bachelor thesis

I'm currently in the 8th semester of my physics bachelor. Starting in april I will write my bachelor thesis. I will work with a raspberry pi to control a bunch of decetors at my university.
With github I can transfer C++ Codes from my pc to the pi and back. 
This is my first time using github. 
In this repository I will learn to use github and try to work with different files.
